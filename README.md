A very simple csv converter into JSON written in Go.

binaries (for unix based systems) included, so just run:
```
./csv2json
```

Or you can build it by youself running with all option you want to 
```
go build 
```

When you run the converter everything that is in `csvs` folder will be converted and storage at `jsons` folder
